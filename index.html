            <h2>What is Osteopetrosis?</h2>
            <p class="about-text1">
                Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic condition which affects the way a person's bones develop and change. Sometimes mistaken for Osteoporosis, which refers to the thinning of bones, Osteopetrosis causes bones to become thicker. There are various forms and genetic strains. Even if two people have the same strain, they might be affected differently. 
            </p>

                <p class="about-text2">
                    Osteopetrosis is progressive which means it gets worse over time. Although bones become thicker, this doesn't make them stronger. Bones may be tough (like marble), but they're also dry (like chalk) because of a lack of bone marrow.
                    <span class="about-spacer"></span>
                    So if you snap a piece of chalk in half, it will break under a little pressure, but it cant be joint back together. Healthy bones, which do have healthy bone marrow, will work to remove the broken and damaged bone pieces and replace the pieces with new, healthy healed bone.
